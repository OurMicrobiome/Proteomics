## Welcome to Proteomics!
  
  
#### Hanna Choi's Ongoing work:  

##### Looking at Specific Metabolites
* Boxplot for **Glyceric Acid**  
Its difference between the **organic** controlled and heated conditions are the most statistically significant in the samples.

* Boxplot for **L-leucine**  
Its difference between the **mineral** controlled and heated conditions are the third most stiatically signficant after two unknown metabolites.
